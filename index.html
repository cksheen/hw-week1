            <h1>So How to Get Start</h1>
            <p>
                The best way to learn a new skill is to mimic. Before you are familiar with the concepts and the skills of web design, it is good to copy the code, modify the code and test the code on your web browser. That is the easist way to feel the power of HTML and CSS. Once you see the web you designed on the Internet, you will know that you can do anything you want.
